The Odin Project - Project 2: Landing Page

I will trying to set up a webpage to replicate the design image supplied by TOP.

Hoping to demonstrate proficiency with basic CSS and Flexbox. This will be my second go-around, and I hope to not struggle on it quite as much as I did my first time. I feel more confident in my flexbox skills this time around, though still not 100% confident that I can do this with ease. But we're never 100% ready for anything important, are we? We wouldn't grow from our challenges otherwise. Let's do this.

/* Afterword */

After having completed the project, I can safely say I still have so much to learn regarding flexbox. While I cemented some concepts in my head, I still feel that my understanding of the flex-grow/-shrink/-basis elements is
very rudimentary.
